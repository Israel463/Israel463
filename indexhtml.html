				<h1> Introduction to the webpage </h1>
				<p> In this webpage we are going to be seeing or looking at how a basic html webpage page can be created using just basic html codes.</p>
				<br>
				<h2> list of some html attributes and how they can be used </h2>
				<p> in this list am going to be mentioning the few of the tags out of the many tags that we have.</p>
				<ul>
				<li><strong> BOLD TAG</strong></li>
							<p> We have the bold tags The bold tag is a container tag because it has a  closing tag</p>
			<li><strong> ITALIC TAG</strong></li>			<p>	We have the italic tags <i> It is also a container tag because it is has a closing tag.</i> The italic tags can also take a form of<cite> cite it can also be used instead of the <b>I</b> form </cite><p>
			<li><strong> ATTRIBUTE TAG</strong></li>			<p> This tag is used whenever a new text or an attachment want to be added to a webpage, eg when a picture is to be added or when a PDF is to be added. It is also used in creating links either within the webpage or outside the webpage. The attribute tag looks like [a in an angel bracket]</p>
				<li><strong> THE STRONG ATTRIBUTE</strong></li>
				<p> It also act as the bold attribute it is used to bolden a text it is denoted with the character <strong> strong</strong> in an angle bracket.</p>
				</ul>
				<h3 align="middle"> TYPES OF LIST</h3>
				<p>  The list is a way of arrangement of of things either in order of sequence or not arranged at all the list tag is denoted with <b>[li]</b>. Now there are three different kind of list namely:</p><ul>
								<li> ordered list</li>
								<li> unorder list</li>
								<li> definition list</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
								<li><b> ordered list</b></li>
					The ordered list as the name implies is used to create list that are arranged in a given order of sequence or order.The orderd list is denoted by the tag <b>ol</b> in an angle bracket, when using an orderd list pattern the text editor would present the list in a default state of <strong> Arabic numerals, </strong>	 ie the normal counting number and it can also be changed to any format of numbring of your choice by using an attribute called the <b><cite>Type</cite></b> attribite with an [=] sign and a quotation sign [""] and then using any kind of counting system of your choice <br>
					
					Example 
					<ol>
					<p> list on how an html format should be followed</p>
					<li>Doctype </li>
					<li>html tag </li>
					<li>head tag</li>
					<li>body tag</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
			<li>	<strong> unordered list</strong></li>
				<p> The second kind of list is the unordred list it is used whenever a programmer want to make a list of things but that kind of a thing doesn't  need to be put in an orderd form.</p>
				<p> The unordered list is denoted with the <strong> [ul]</strong> tag </p><br>
				Example 
				<ul>
							<p> list of food item </p>
							<li> rice </li>
							<li> beans</li>
							<li> garri </li>
							<li> spaghetti</li>
				</ul>
			<li><strong> Definition list</strong></li>
				<p> The definition list as the name implies is used in definition.The definition list is divided into three main parts name 
				<ol>
				<li> dl: definition list</li>
					<li> dt: definition term</li>
					<li> dd: definition data</li><br>
					</ol>
					In making a definition list u open a dl tag first and the dt and the dd would follow inside the dl tag.
					<p>once u have created the dl tag u don't need to create another one again  all you need to do is to fix your definition term (dt) and your definition data(dd) in the between the the definition list tag (dl). </p>
					</p>
			<dl>
							<dt><b> what is html</b></dt>
							<dd> This is used in forming  the layout and structure of a webpage </dd>
							<dt><strong><cite> what is css</cite></strong></dt>
							<dd> this is used to create the format and add style to a webpage.</dd>
							<dt><b><i> what is Java script </i></b></dt>
							<dd> Java script is a programming language that is used to add logic and interactivity to a webpage.</dd>
			</dl>
				</ul>
